        <p> I joined Physis to design <a class="color-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/physispt/">publications</a> for social media to promote the ENEF event, a national event that gathers Physic students from Portugal. Given its importance, this event requires a lot of teamwork, management and quality content. As I proved my skills in graphic design, video editing and typography skills, I asked
          to be a permenant menber of Physis. I became the image and comunication team coordenator, where I developed an 
          kanban system with excel and trello to manage my team and to reduce misinterpretations and the time in development of
          designs. I created, directed and helped the development of design for publications, websites, flyers, posters and 
          videos. During this time, I also became President of the Fiscal Vouncil. By showing diligence in my work, in the next mandate, I became 
          treasurer and, consequently, a member of the running board. In this role, I applied and improved 
          what I learned about accountability in my degree.

              was aimed to prevent wildfires by developing small devices to be placed in forests.
              When one deviced burned, it would send messages with it's position and, as such, a lot of this devices togheter would map out 
              the begining and propagation of wild fires. We made a prototype and submitted it to various national contests. With that, we received three honorable mentions and, fortunately, won the first place and prize of <a class="color-link" href="https://www.ordemengenheiros.pt/pt/a-ordem/regiao-centro/premios-novas-fronteiras-da-engenharia/">Novas Fronteiras da Engenharia</a> in 2018.

          <p> This documentary is perhaps my first big project. It is about my 9th grade class, friends and some teachers. 
            I started it due to my interest in design, movies and typography, but the most important factor was the feeling of really enjoying my class – we were really good friends and that was such a happy memory that I wanted to capture and maintain. 
            For this project, during my free time, I started reading about graphic design, learning how to shoot manual photography, making videos and 3D animations and experimenting with photoshop to its full potential.
