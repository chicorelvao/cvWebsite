                <p> This was my first job related to my degree. During 6 months, while I was finishing my masters degree, I was also researching and writing my thesis about magnetic 3D tactile sensors. This austrian research institute was interested in developing 3D buttons, which can sense complex three dimensional thouch patterns, unlike a simple click button or a two dimensional touchpad.
                A 3D button could be used for example in car key fobs, to control the movement of vehicles or to provide tactile sense to a robot.

                Our team 
                
                The company had already tried to design and simulate a magnetic 3D tactile, but the results were lacking.
                
                Mumax3 was the core program of this program, since it's a GPU-based micromagnetic simulator. Unfortunately, it's scripting abilities are very limited.

                <p> In small internship, I learned about how the PET scan and MRI work from a physics point of view, as well as the algorithms used to construct an image. I had to follow the typical day in a clinic integrated with a research institute. Futhermore, I also learned about the regulatory and law aspects concerning radiotion safety and disposal. </p>

                <p> This was my first experience at a company. I learned how to work in an office and production environment.
                    My main goal was to help assembling an AGV, but I also made an eletronical debug of the AGV's control unit and some voltage test on a PCB that would be sent to space.
                    With this, I gained a lot of technical skills such as: eletronic compatibility design, welding, torque to apply to some type of bolts and other materials. I also developed skills at reading documentation, writing and managing bills of materials and managing factory inventory.

                <p> My first internship was about manipulating theorical data obtained from models that were applied to data of mesaured properties of neutron stars.I worked on very old <a class="color-link" href="https://github.com/chicorelvao/Inside-Neutron-Stars">codes</a> written in fortran and developed scripts in bash and python to present the data 
                    in a meanignfull way. Me and my group made and publish an poster to present our job to the local departement of physics.
                    This whole opportunity teached me to work at an university environment with professors and colleagues.
