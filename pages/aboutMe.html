      <p class="justify-content-end margin-p">I was born in Coimbra, Portugal in 1999. As I grew up, 
        the more interested I became in everything around me and joined in various groups like scouts or other volunteer's associations. Even 
        though I was bad at mathematics, I started to develop a taste in this subject. I
        became top of my class at mathematics in highschool, but physics always caught my atenttion. For this reason, I enroled in University of Coimbra, in 2018 and to this day, I study physics engineering and really enjoy my degree.
        I try to keep my skills and knowdelge by readding books or enrolling in organizations or groups.
        I do love keep building myself up and becoming the best I can be, but to me relationships are an essential part of my life, so I don’t trade them for personal gain.

  <p class="margin-p">Throughout my life, I participated in various activities involving other people. During these, it always came to my mind the importance of teamwork and having a good and relaxed social environment. 
    I really enjoy my hobbies, but it’s not always about joy. They are also a way for me to learn and improve various traits of my personality and areas in my life.

            <h4>603 Antanhol - 2020/2021</h4>
            <p> I joined the scouts movement when I was 6 years old. When I was a "lobito" - young wolf - I developed a sense of orienting my actions and decisions by moral values typical of heroes movies. 
              Later on, it was
              very important to plane head, in group, the camps: where to sleep and visit, some activities and games to pass time. We even organized events to raise money to fund material and the activities for the group.  
              It was also crucial having to develop some soft skills like: developing friendshid, communication, stewardship, accounting, stress tenacity, group arguments, pioneering construtions, physical ability, 
              orientation in unknow places with maps and compass. 
              In regional, national and international activities it
              was essencial to be an open and fun person so that meetings strangers could be done quickly in order to attain certain objectives.
              One of the most rewarding and significant parts of my personal path on scouts was serving and helping the local community where we were established.

            <p>Designed to be a religious group, the Youth Group, to me is more of a friends group dedicated to enliven the small village of Palheira. Together, we made three movies, one of which won a prize on a national <a class="color-link" href="https://www.caminhos.info/">contest</a>.
            From writing, interviewing, delivering the local biannual newspaper, participating and producing music for music festivals, to helping with the organization of the local summer festivity, I developed my video editing and social skills.

        <p>At a Scout’s International Camp in France, following a natural catastrophe, I volunteered to deliver food, water and blankets for many scouts’ groups who lost their tents, food and clothing. For this reason, I was awarded with a diploma of distinction by my scouts grouping’s board.
