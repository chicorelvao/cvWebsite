      <p class="justify-content-end margin-p">I was born in Coimbra, Portugal in 1999. Has I grew up, 
        the more interested I became in everything around me, specially philoshopy. Even 
        though I was bad at mathematics, I started to develop a taste in this subject. I 
        became top of my class at mathematics, but physics always caught my atenttion. I enroled
        in University of Coimbra, in 2018. I study physics engineering and I really enjoy what I study.
        Specially because I enjoy a good challenge from this kind of problems. I develop a taste also for 
        psicology, economics and accounting during my university years. I try to keep my skills and knowdelge
        by readding books or enrolling in organizations or groups.</p>

            <p> I joined the scouts movement when I was 6 years old. When I was a "lobito" - young wolf - I developed 
              a sense of orienting my actions and decisions by moral values typical of heroes movies. During camps and later years, it was
              very important to plane head, in group, the place to sleep and visit, activities and games to pass time, to develop 
              friendshid, communication, stewardship, accounting, stress tenacity, emotional group arguments, pioneering construtions, physical ability, 
              orientation in unknow places with maps and compass. In regional, national and international activities it
              was very importante to be an open and fun person to quickly meet strangers to attain certain objetives. We even
              prepared events to raise money for activities and material for the group.
              Serving and helping the local community around my group was a very rewarding and significant part of my 
              personal path in scouts.

              liven up the small village of Palheira. We did 3 movies, where one movie won a prize in national
